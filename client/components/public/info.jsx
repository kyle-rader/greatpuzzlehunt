            What is the Great Puzzle Hunt?
          </Accordion.Title>
          <Accordion.Content>
            A puzzle hunt is like a scavenger hunt, with puzzles.
            Teams (size 4-6) travel on foot about campus (outdoors) solving a
            collection of puzzles (logic puzzles, word scrambles, trivia, etc.).
            Lots of prizes will be awarded. Whether your team places first or two
            hundred and fifty-first, competing in a puzzle hunt is a great way to
            stretch your mental muscles, bond with your teammates, and have a lot of fun!
